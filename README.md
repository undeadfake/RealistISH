# RealistISH

RealistISH mod for KSP

Q: What is RealistISH?

A: It's a lightweight realism mod aimed at KSP players who want an extra challenge without overhauling the entire game.

Q: What does it change?

A: Many things, but these are the most important changes:

1- No reaction wheels on crewed spacecraft and airplane cockpits.
2- Reaction wheels are a lot less powerful now.
3- Big reduction in solar panel power generation, but they're lighter as well. Based on real-life performance. You'll now need massive panels for power-hungry spacecraft.
3- Command pods are autonomous. You can now do uncrewed tests without adding extra control parts.
5- Massive thrust reduction for RCS thrusters.
6- Performance changes for some engines, aimed at replicating their real-life counterparts (with BDB-style balance). This might include change in mass, thrust, specific impulse and even propellants used.
7- Real names for some parts (e.g. Puff engine is now AJ10-190)
8- Mods with inconsistent balancing now have better balance (e.g. Knes, Fuji)

Q: Does it have any dependencies?

A: RealistISH doesn't have any actual dependencies, but since it's aimed at a more realistic gameplay experience, it's strongly encouraged that you install the mods listed in the "Recommended" section.

Q: Which mods are compatible with RealistISH?

A: All of them, I guess. RealistISH shouldn't cause any compatiblity issues with other mods, but installing mods not listed in the "officially supported" section could lead to an unbalanced gameplay.
