# RealistISH

RealistISH mod for KSP

Q: What is RealistISH?

A: It's a lightweight realism mod aimed at KSP players who want an extra challenge without overhauling the entire game.

Q: What does it change?

A: Many things, but these are the most important changes:

1- No reaction wheels on crewed spacecraft and airplane cockpits.

2- Reaction wheels are not as powerful.

3- Big reduction in solar panel power generation, but they're lighter as well. Based on real-life performance. You'll now need massive panels for power-hungry spacecraft, but there's no noticeable impact in launch mass.

3- Command pods are autonomous. You can now do uncrewed tests without adding extra command parts.

5- Thrust reduction for RCS thrusters. Values based on real-life components.

6- Performance changes for some engines, aimed at replicating their real-life counterparts (with BDB-style balance). This might include changes in mass, size, thrust, specific impulse and even propellants used.

7- Real names for some parts (e.g. Puff engine is now AJ10-190).

8- Mods with balancing not entirely consistent with BDB (e.g. Knes, Fuji) are now rebalanced.

Q: Does it have any dependencies?

A: RealistISH doesn't have any actual dependencies, but since it's aimed at a more realistic gameplay experience, it's strongly encouraged that you install the mods listed in the "Recommended" section.

Q: Which mods are compatible with RealistISH?

A: All of them, I guess. RealistISH shouldn't cause any compatiblity issues with other mods, but installing mods not listed in the "officially supported" section could lead to an unbalanced gameplay.

Recommended mods:

- RESCALE 3.2x or JNSQ. RESCALE 2.5x is an option, but you'll see better results with 3.2x.
